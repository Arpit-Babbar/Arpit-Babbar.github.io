I will be presenting my PhD work on admissibility preserving subcell limiters for LWFR schemes in [IGHASC: Indo-german Workshop on Hardware-aware Scientific Computing](https://conan.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/events/hasc_workshop2024/). The paper I will be presenting is [Admissibility Preserving Subcell Limiter for Laxâ€“Wendroff Flux Reconstruction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-024-02482-9).
