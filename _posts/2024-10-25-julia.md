I will be presenting my workflow using julia over SSH using VS code and Pluto in the [Julia user group Mainz](https://github.com/ranocha/Julia_User_Group_Mainz). The result of this workflow is an interactive environment where I can run my simulations and visualize them without having to leave VS Code.
