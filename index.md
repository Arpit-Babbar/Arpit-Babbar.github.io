I am fourth year PhD student under Professor [Praveen Chandrashekar](cpraveen.github.io) at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Centre for Applicable Mathematics](math.tifrbng.res.in). My work is on development of efficient numerical algorithms for simulation of advection dominated fluid flows. The broad class of numerical algorithms that I study are higher order methods. These methods are notable for having better accuracy with fewer grid points and doing more number crunching and lesser memory transfers, something that [modern computers like](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465514002549).

The particular higher order methods that I work on are Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) schemes. These simulate flows time dependent flows without depending on an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver and can thus achieve higher order accuracy in a single stage, minimizing memory transfers even more than standard higher order methods. During my PhD, my colleagues and I made the following contributions to the LWFR scheme
1. Enhancement of stability and accuracy, see peer-reviewed work [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999122004855)
2. Provably admissibility preserving shock capturing capturing with particular focus on maintaining the high order accuracy, see the preprint of work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10781)
3. Embedded error-based time step computation method, see the abstract of ICOSAHOM presentation [here](https://sigongji.icosahom2023.org/wp/SessionPaperList.asp?code=2C3)
