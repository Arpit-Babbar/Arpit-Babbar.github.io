I am a postdoctoral researcher under [Professor Hendrik Ranocha](https://ranocha.de/) in [the Numerical Mathematics group at Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz](https://www.nummath.math.uni-mainz.de/). I am funded by the [Mainz Institute of Multiscale Modeling (M3ODEL)](https://model.uni-mainz.de/).

Prior to my current position, I was a PhD student under [Professor Praveen Chandrashekar](https://cpraveen.github.io) at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Centre for Applicable Mathematics](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/). My work is on development of efficient numerical algorithms for simulation of advection dominated fluid flows. The broad class of numerical algorithms that I study are higher order methods. These methods are notable for having better accuracy with fewer grid points and doing more number crunching and lesser memory transfers, something that [modern computers like](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465514002549).

The particular higher order methods that I worked on during my PhD are Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) schemes. These simulate time dependent flows without depending on an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver and can thus achieve higher order accuracy in a single stage, minimizing memory transfers even more than standard higher order methods. My PhD thesis can be found [here](https://babbar.dev/assets/thesis.pdf). In collaboration with my colleagues, my PhD thesis includes the following contributions to the LWFR scheme.
1. **Enhancement of stability and accuracy**: [Article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999122004855) [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02954)
2. **Provably admissibility-preserving shock capturing with particular focus on maintaining the benefits of high order accuracy:**  [Article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-024-02482-9)  [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10781)
3. **Embedded error-based time step computation, tested on adaptive curvilinear meshes.**  [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11926) [Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113622)
4. **Advection-diffusion equations like Navier-Stokes** [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12669)
5. **Generalized framework for admissibility preservation, source terms** [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01442)
6. **Proven linear equivalence with ADER schemes where local evolution is performing by solving an implicit equation** [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18937)
7. **Accurate and robust multiderivative Runge-Kutta method in a Flux Reconstruction framework** [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02141)
