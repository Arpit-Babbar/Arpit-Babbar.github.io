Welcome to my still-under-construction website. 

I am about to give a talk in the [Numerical Engine Room series](https://numerical-engine-room-talks.github.io/) which is organized by the developers of the wonderful package [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/Trixi-Framework/Trixi.jl). 

You can see my cv [here](cv.pdf). Thanks for visiting!
